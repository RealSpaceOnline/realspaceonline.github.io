                            <p>Welcome to Real Space friends! This is a place where I will be putting all of my
                                work both past present and future, this includes my books, short films, and exclusive videos
                                that I want to hold from YouTube. This will be my place to share all of my hobbies wit you all, 
                                I have had a lot of other websites that I have shut down due to me losing interest or running
                                out of ideas for the page since they were all niche sites that only had one or two topics, 
                                this page is going to be a little different. This website is going to be covering all of the things
                                that I love to do, these things will include what I have already stated above and also anything that
                                I find that I enjoy doing in the future, I will put a chatroom in eventually where you can talk to me 
                                and the rest of my community in real time. I would like to please ask everyone to be respectful of 
                                all of the people on this page because I am going to be adding in comment sections on some
                                of the pages on here, I just want this to be a place for everyone to feel accepted and know that they
                                can come here to have some fun and make new friends. Thank you for reading my little paragraph here,
                                I hope you enjoy the website!
                            </p>
